;;; This report lists warnings and possible problems that were encountered
;;; by the GenBank parser used in PathoLogic.
;;;
;;; One type of potential problem reported is where a 'gene' feature
;;; was present, without being followed by an additional feature (such as 'CDS')
;;; that would have provided additional information about the gene product.
;;; Potentially, these are erroneous omissions in the Genbank file,
;;; because it is unclear what the product type should be.
;;; However, solitary gene features commonly occur among pseudo-genes.
;;;
;;;
;;; If you want to change GenBank annotation file(s) to improve their parsability, 
;;; then update the files, reinitialize the KB, and re-run the Build.  If you want
;;; to avoid having to reinitialize in the future, use the Trial Parse 
;;; command until you are satisfied with the parse results, and only then
;;; Build.
